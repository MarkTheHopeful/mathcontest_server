# mathcontest_server
Inner server for mathcontest at the vk group MathJokes

To work properly all the packages from the dependencies file have to be installed.
To run the server simply run the start_server.sh
To play a multiplayer hot-seat game (the only possibility yet) run
python3 game.py

Most of the things will be changed. There are no actual working version of the game server yet
Stay tuned
